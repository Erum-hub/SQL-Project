# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to clean and transform raw eCommerce data to demonstrate effective data processing techniques and methodologies.

## Process
### Step 1: Import Data
### Step 2: Identify goals 
### Step 3: Clean data
### Step 4: Data Transformation and aggregation
### Step 5: Analyze data

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
During the import process of the project file, It was difficult to decide the data types. I decided to keep many of the table columns as 'character varying'. This decision was made to expedite the import process and avoid initial data type mismatches. This led to significant additional efforts in the cleaning process. 

## Future Goals

If more time was available, I would have focused more on the analysis of key metrices to derive actionable insights.
I also have to setup primary keys to prepare ERD
